# The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab
The _Numerical Method With Matlab_ repository contains matlab codes for some Numerical Methods which are used to solve complex engineering problems in a simpler way. These codes were written for **MECH 105** class taught by _**Dr. Samuel Bechara**_ at **Colorado State University** in Fall 2018.

The _Numerical Mecthods with Matlab_ repository includes the following Numerical estimation functions:-
* Bisection
* False Position
* Golden Ratio Optimization
* Heun's Method
* LU Factorization with inverse
* LU Factorization with pivoting
* Simpson's Method
