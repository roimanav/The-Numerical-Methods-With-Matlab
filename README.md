# The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab
The _Numerical Method With Matlab_ repository contains matlab codes for some Numerical Methods which are used to solve complex engineering problems in a simpler way. These codes were written for **MECH 105** class taught by _**Dr. Samuel Bechara**_ at **Colorado State University** in Fall 2018.

The _Numerical Meothods with Matlab_ repository includes the following Numerical estimation functions:-
* [Bisection](https://github.com/roimanav/The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab/tree/master/Bisection)
* [False Position](https://github.com/roimanav/The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab/tree/master/False%20Postion)
* [Golden Ratio Optimization](https://github.com/roimanav/The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab/tree/master/Golden%20Ratio%20Optimization)
* [Heun's Method](https://github.com/roimanav/The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab/tree/master/Heun-s%20Method)
* [LU Factorization with inverse](https://github.com/roimanav/The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab/tree/master/LU%20Factorization%20With%20Inverse)
* [LU Factorization with pivoting](https://github.com/roimanav/The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab/tree/master/LU%20Factorization%20with%20Pivoting)
* [Simpson's Method](https://github.com/roimanav/The-Numerical-Methods-With-Matlab/tree/master/Simpson-s%20Method)

Every function has a folder by its name in the repository. The function folder contains the mfile for the function which can be run on MATLAB and a README.md file describing the function. Some folder might also contain a flow chart of the function.
